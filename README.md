========================

"One Defiant Extension" - TDK's [Lord of Ultima](http://www.lordofultima.com/home)  [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) browser extension.

This extension was developed slowly over time only up to a certain point in the game.  It may be a little messy and will most certainly not be (fully) compatible with the current version of the game, though some features may be adapted to work with it.  Information about what the extension can do is available in the docs page: [LoUDefiant_about.html](http://senocular.github.io/chrome-extension-lou-tdk/docs/LoUDefiant_about.html).

Note: The compiled extension installers (.crx, .xpi) are not included and only the Chrome version of the source has been made available in this repo.  The core source is the same, only the extension wrappers would be different.  For more information on Chrome extensions, see: http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html
