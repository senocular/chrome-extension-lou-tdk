<h1> One Defiant Extension</h1>
<p>Current Version: <b>0.0.29</b> 

	<ul style="color:red">
		<li><strong>NO LONGER BEING ACTIVELY UPDATED</strong></li>
		<li><strong>NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT VERSION OF LORD OF ULTIMA</strong></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>One Defiant Extension, or The Defiant (TDK) Extension, is a browser extension built for The Defiant alliance on World 24 of Lord of Ultima. It was originally created for the Palace team to make it easier to collect enlightenment information but has since expanded to include other features.</p>
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

	<li><a href="#features">Features</a></li>
	<li><a href="#releasenotes">Release Notes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#knownissues">Known Issues</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p> The TDK Extension is available as a Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox extension. Clicking on the link for your respective browser should automatically start the installation process (if you're looking for the extension source code, it is exposed after installation).</p>
<ul class="download">
	<li><a href="LoUDefiant.crx">Download for Chrome</a></li>
</ul>
<ul class="download">
	<li><a href="LoUDefiant.xpi">Download for Firefox</a>*</li>
</ul>
<p>Once installed, restart the game (or the browser in Firefox's case) for the extension to take effect. It will periodically check for and automatically download updates*. You may also return to this page in your browser at any time to get a new version. This page is also accessible from the About tab in the main extension interface.</p>
<p><i>* Firefox version does not support automatic updates so you will need to install new releases from the link above.</i></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Features of the TDK extension are integrated into the Lord of Ultima game interface. Some are consolidated in one tabbed window unique to the extension (the &quot;main extension interface&quot;) while others are distributed throughout other panels and windows within the game.</p>
<p><i>Note: Some features are enabled immediately when the extension has been installed, others will need to be enabled manually.</i></p>
<p>To access main extension interface, you can use any of the buttons at the bottom of the screen inserted by the extension.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Main_interface.jpg" width="636" height="235" alt="main interface" /></p>
<p><i>Note: Some screen shots shown may be from older versions of the extension so they may differ from what you see in the game.</i></p>
<p>These buttons can be hidden by clicking on the TDK title. They can also be more permanently customized or even removed completely through the TDK Options dialog. If removed, you're only access to the main extension interface is through a TDK tab added to Lord of Ultima's own Options dialog.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Notes allow you to keep easily accessible information in a floating dialog window. You can create new, and access saved notes from the Notes tab in the main extension dialog. When you create a new note, the note is presented in edit mode. Add text and BBCode (or even HTML) and click the Done button to see the final, rendered note. At anytime you can click the Edit button in the rendered view to edit your not further.</p>
<p>You can save a note by clicking on the Save checkbox at the bottom of the note dialog. This will make it listed in the notes tab. Notes can be unlisted by un-checking Save in the note itself or by deleting the note from the Notes tab. </p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notes_tab.jpg" width="604" height="482" alt="notes tab" /></p>
<p>Integrated Open in Notepad buttons exist in forum threads,  the chat window, the info panel for selected cities, and email messages allowing you to create new, pre-populated notes from those panels and dialogs.  Selected city notes are unique in that they will show an asterisk (*) next to the notes button when a note has already been saved for that city. These notes are associated with the city using the city's coordinates in square brackets ([]) as the first text in the note.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notepad_button_thread.jpg" width="608" height="176" alt="notepad thread" /></p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notepad_button_chat.jpg" width="588" height="204" alt="notepad chat" /></p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notepad_button_city.jpg" width="386" height="269" alt="notepad button city" /></p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notepad_button_email.jpg" width="608" height="483" alt="notepad email" /></p>
<h3>Saved Palace Trade Routes</h3>
<p>You can now save palace trade routes (sending equal amounts of wood and stone as available in your source city) in a new Trades tab. New trade routes can be added from the Trades tab itself or from a new &quot;+ Trade&quot; button in the Quick Send buttons row for a selected city in Region view. </p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Palace_trades_tab.jpg" width="606" height="539" alt="Palace trades" /></p>
<p>Clicking on Edit will allow you to edit a trade route. Clicking on the From or To city names will focus on those cities. And clicking on Send will send the trade. Trades sent are equivalent to clicking on the Quick &quot;Send W&amp;S&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Send!!!&quot;) button a selected city from region view.</p>
<p><em>Note: Only palace trades using carts are currently supported.</em></p>
<h3>Quick Attack! and Send! Buttons</h3>
<p>These buttons are injected into the selected city information pane seen in the Region Map view. They make it easy to send troops or resources to the selected city.</p>
<p> The Attack! group of buttons will dispatch an order for all available non-baron units in the current city to attack, plunder, siege, or support the selected city. </p>
<p>The Send! group of buttons send all available resources to a city by cart, either as a palace trade if the selected city is a palace, or a regular trade if not. The number of carts used by the Send! buttons can be regulated within the extension Options tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Attack_and_Send_buttons.jpg" width="390" height="606" alt="attack and send buttons" /></p>
<p>The placement of these buttons within the stack can also be controlled in the Options tab.</p>
<h3>Building Counts</h3>
<p>City Building Counts shows a box in the left information pane containing the combined level and number of buildings for the current city in the City Map view.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Building_count.jpg" width="344" height="273" alt="building count" /></p>
<p>Building levels appear under building icons on the left with building counts on the right in parenthesis. When building levels are maxed, they appear in <b>bold</b>.</p>
<p><i>Note: This feature is updated based on certain reoccurring, though infrequent, events within the game so if performance is a concern for you, you may want to consider disabling it in the Options tab.</i></p>
<h3>Single Click City Actions</h3>
<p>Single Click actions simplify city building/destruction by allowing you to click a location within a city map once and have a certain action performed for that location. For example, using the Demolish action allows you to click buildings or resource nodes once to demolish them rather than selecting them first, and then choosing the demolish option.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Click_to_demolish.jpg" width="348" height="229" alt="click to demolish" /></p>
<h3>Extended Chat Commands</h3>
<p>With Extended Chat Commands, One Defiant Extension greatly increases your options with the chat window with new commands. New commands allow you to perform common options such as navigating to a location on the map, opening up a specific dialog, or even sending email. Commands include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>/tdkhelp</b> or <b>/tdk?</b> = Display the list of available commands</li>
	<li><b> /cls</b> = Clears the chat window</li>
	<li> <b>/mail</b> or <b>/email</b> [<i>to</i> [,<i>subject</i> [,<i>message</i>]]] = Displays the write email dialog or if all three comma (,) separated fields are present sends an email. If sending to multiple users, separate their name with a semicolon (;)<br />
		<img src="images/tdk/Commands_email_open.jpg" width="604" height="525" alt="command email" /><br /><br />
		<img src="images/tdk/Commands_email_send.jpg" width="604" height="203" alt="command email sent" />
	</li>
	<li> <b>/show</b> <i>what-to-show</i> = Displays or hides (if already visible) a game window. Windows (by <i>what-to-show</i> id) include:
		<ul>
			<li>reports</li>
			<li>quests</li>
			<li>research</li>
			<li>overviews</li>
			<li>rankings</li>
			<li>mail</li>
			<li>alliance</li>
			<li>social</li>
			<li>items</li>
			<li>shop</li>
			<li>profiles</li>
			<li>attacks</li>
			<li>virtues</li>
			<li>supporter</li>
			<li>mail [to [,subject [,message]]]<br />
			<i>( Example: <kbd>/show mail senocular,If I hadn't told you already...,I like the extension!</kbd> )</i></li>
			<li>overview</li>
			<li>diplomacy</li>
			<li>members</li>
			<li>forums</li>
			<li>tdk</li>
			<li>dailyreward <i>or</i> dailyfreereward <i>or</i> DFR</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>/goto</b> [<i>cXX</i> or <i>XXX:XXX</i>] = Goes to a continent or coordinate</li>
	<li> <b>/whois</b> <i>player-name</i> = Displays the info dialog for a player</li>
	<li> <b>/whoare</b> <i>alliance-name-or-abbreviation</i> = Displays the info dialog for an alliance</li>
	<li> <b>/whatis</b> <i>XXX:XXX</i> = Displays city info dialog (reports) for the city at the coordinates</li>
	<li><b>/eval</b> <i>javascript-expression</i> = Evaluates a javascript expression in the context of the game (or more specifically, the extension)</li>
	<li><b>/version</b> = Displays the current TDK extension version in the chat window</li>
	<li><b>/note</b> <i>note-text</i> = Saves a note to the Notes page with the specified text</li>
	<li><b>/activity</b> <i>user-in-your-alliance</i> = Shows the last login date of the user specified (based on server, inaccuracy not fault of extension)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chat Notifications</h3>
<p>Set up notifications (<b>off by default</b>) to alert you when someone whispers to you, mentions you by name, or posts a message containing custom-defined text in the game chat. These can be useful to help prevent missing important messages when the chat panel is minimized.</p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notification_private.jpg" width="712" height="200" alt="notification private" /></p>
<p>When specifying custom text, you can specify multiple matches by separating text with commas (,). Unfortunately this prevents commas from being used in string matches. As an example:	<kbd>battle,for the win,gold</kbd>	would create a notification if either &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;for the win&quot;, or &quot;gold&quot; was mentioned in chat.
</p>
<p>To prevent spamming, only one notification can be present at a time. New chat notifications will replace older ones.</p>
<h3>Daily Free Reward Notifications</h3>
<p>Have a notification activate when the Daily Free Reward dialog appears to allow you to hide the dialog for later. </p>
<p><img src="images/tdk/Notification_daily_reward.jpg" width="664" height="489" alt="notification daily reward" /></p>
<p>If you hide the Daily Free Reward dialog AND dismiss the notification window, you can still access the hidden Daily Free Reward dialog from the Other tab in the main extension interface. You can also use the chat command <kbd>/show dailyfreereward</kbd> to toggle the visibility of the Daily Free Reward dialog.</p>
<h3>Cities List</h3>
<p>A simple list of your cities in a compact window. More filtering features to control what cities are displayed will be available in future releases.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Opening chat in Notepad windows does not preserve BBCode.  This is a limitation of the chat panel. BBCode information is lost by the time the chat panel gets the chat text which prevents the Notepad window from being able to obtain it.</li>
	<li>Some text won't be recognized for chat notifications, particularly &quot;Shared Report&quot; in shared report links since this text was not in the original message (which is what notifications check) and is instead generated by the game client and inserted into the chat window after the fact.</li>
	<li>There may be conflicts when using the Attack! buttons when dealing with multiple, incompatible unit types such as a combination of land and water units. For example, I've seen this not work with a city containing ballista and sloops. The Support! command would not work because the ballista and sloops could not be sent out on the same order.</li>
	<li>Using the Single Click to feature may get you booted from the game for a short time. The game has safety measures in place to prevent botting. There are some safety precautions taken by the extension to help reduce the likelihood of this happening, but ultimately it is up to you to not abuse this functionality in a way that cause this to happen. (In other words, don't click too fast.)</li>
</ul>
<p>To report issues with the extension, send an in-game email to senocular. Include the extension version (seen at the bottom of the main extension dialog) and the browser you're using along with a detailed description of the problem you're having.</p>
